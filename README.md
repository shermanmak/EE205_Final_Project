# EE205_Final_Project
For Chris (How to build project):                 
    1. $make game                       
    2. $./game


This is our final project for EE205: Object-Oriented Programming (C++)

Game information:
This game is essentially a dating-simulator themed RPG game. You are Nick, and you are trying to win back the love of your life who left you for the cool MATLAB Chad.
Nick needs to raise his dating-stats before he is ready to take on the evil MATLAB Chad and win back his girl's heart.
We used SFML in conjunction with the new object-oriented programming techniques we learned throughout the semester.

To run and play game:
  1. Have Unix based command line with C++ complier and SFML installed on OS.
  2. Compile. (Enter command: make game)
  3. Execute. (Enter command: ./game)

The (make clean) command will remove all .o files.

Based on the number of files and dependencies we had, in addition to the linking of .o files with the SFML library, we did not use the standard /tst, /bin /src, /dep folders.
If we had more time and experience, we would definitely try to organize both our Makefile and code.

Although this game is not perfect, it taught us the true value of object-oriented languages (sometimes the hard way).
